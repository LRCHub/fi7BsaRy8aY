Look up at the horizon together
as one
A star is on the rise
and it's only begun
The pivotal moment
we're clamoring for
An infinite future's at our door
Yeah
It's a timeless story
with a new feel
Not just allegory, it's real
Wake up, big dreams about
to come true
That means it's time to
break through
Never knew we could make it
so far, but we're striving,
thriving, here we are
Achieving the impossible
We're virtually unstoppable
We can't sit still,
we just keep moving
Now everybody sing!
We're making our way
to the next dimension,
We'll reinvent the world
that we live in
We'll greet every day
with new intentions
Break conventions,
run right through! (This is it!)
Been smashing barriers
left and right
(That's our Myth!)
Strong as we ever were,
scaling heights
(It's endless!)
So get together, let's reunite!
Reach up, reach out,
the future's bright.
We've been together
for what feels like an eternity,
The times are changing,
but we're ready for infinity,
yeah
Our stories align, we're gonna
go far when we combine
So look at the horizon
and then look beyond,
We'll marvel at the skies
and the strength of our bond,
We're making a vow
to the smiling stars,
A powerful moment
that's all ours～
The seasons change,
but we keep shining
Now everybody sing
(Keep it going!)
We're making our way
to the next dimension,
A million thrills
in every direction
We'll give every mile
our full attention,
Breaking tension,
breaking through
(We won't miss!)
With endless energy,
stronger ties (we got this!)
A perfect harmony we devise
(We Promise!)
So clap along with me
(Time to rise!)
The future's right
before our eyes.
A new dimension of freedom
that we've found,
(Yeah, we've made it)
We're breaking out of the mold,
no longer bound
(We're unlimited)
We're gonna spring to life
and break the chains
Turn up the hype,
can't be contained
We're shaking up the status quo,
No time to stop,
we're good to go!
The whole wide world is
listening,
So everybody sing!
We're making our way
to the next dimension,
We're living out the dreams
we believe in,
Excitement
beyond our comprehension,
There's no question
we'll break through!
(Don't relent!)
We'll keep aspiring to excel
(It's Advent!)
It's awe-inspiring,
going well (Represent!)
So light the fire
and let's rebel!
The future's brighter,
we can tell!
