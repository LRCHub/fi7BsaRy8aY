[00:14.28] Look up at the horizon together as one
[00:17.43] A star is on the rise and it's only begun
[00:20.69] The pivotal moment we're clamoring for
[00:23.82] An infinite future's at our door
[00:39.82] 
[00:27.04] (Yeah)
[00:27.52] It's a timeless story with a new feel
[00:29.21] Not just allegory, it's real
[00:30.86] Wake up, big dreams about to come true
[00:33.16] That means it's time to break through
[00:34.55] Never knew we could make it so far
[00:35.81] But we're striving, thriving, here we are
[00:37.57] Achieving the impossible
[00:39.13] We're virtually unstoppable
[00:52.63] 
[00:40.80] We can't sit still, we just keep moving
[00:43.84] Now everybody sing!
[00:53.34] 
[00:47.02] We're making our way to the next dimension
[00:50.07] We'll reinvent the world that we live in
[00:53.50] We'll greet every day with new intentions
[00:56.70] Break conventions, run right through!
[00:59.61] (This is it!)
[01:00.13] Been smashing barriers left and right
[01:02.83] (That's our Myth!)
[01:03.31] Strong as we ever were, scaling heights
[01:06.10] (It's endless!)
[01:06.57] So get together, let's reunite!
[01:09.27] Reach up, reach out, the future's bright
[01:29.27] 
[01:12.95] We've been together for what feels like an eternity
[01:16.31] The times are changing, but we are ready for infinity, yeah
[01:19.88] Our stories align
[01:21.41] We're gonna go far when we combine
[01:24.63] So look at the horizon and then look beyond
[01:27.84] We'll marvel at the skies and the strength of our bond
[01:31.04] We're making a vow to the smiling stars
[01:34.22] A powerful moment that's all ours
[01:50.72] 
[01:38.26] The seasons change, but we keep shining
[01:41.59] Now everybody sing
[01:43.63] (Keep it going!)
[01:51.63] 
[01:44.76] We're making our way to the next dimension
[01:47.95] A million thrills in every direction
[01:51.20] We'll give every mile our full attention
[01:54.23] Breaking tension, breaking through
[01:56.96] (We won't miss!)
[01:58.08] With endless energy, stronger ties
[02:00.45] (We got this!)
[02:01.27] A perfect harmony we devise
[02:03.61] (We Promise!)
[02:04.48] So clap along with me
[02:05.73] (Time to rise!)
[02:06.80] The future's right before our eyes
[02:23.80] 
[02:10.88] A new dimension of freedom that we've found
[02:14.66] (Yeah we've made it)
[02:16.92] We're breaking out of the mold, no longer bound
[02:21.20] (We're unlimited)
[02:23.16] We're gonna spring to life and break the chains
[02:24.72] Turn up the hype, can't be contained
[02:26.38] We're shaking up the status quo
[02:27.92] No time to stop, we're good to go!
[02:44.92] 
[02:29.57] The whole wide world is listening
[02:32.79] So everybody sing!
[02:41.79] 
[02:37.59] We're making our way to the next dimension (aah)
[02:40.78] We're living out the dreams we believe in
[02:43.91] Excitement beyond our comprehension
[02:46.94] There's no question, we'll break through!
[02:49.82] (Don't relent!)
[02:50.81] We'll keep aspiring to excel
[02:53.28] (It's Advent!)
[02:53.81] It's awe-inspiring, going well
[02:56.25] (Represent!)
[02:57.05] So light the fire and let's rebel!
[02:59.75] The future's brighter, we can tell!
